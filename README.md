# final-project-skillo
This repository is created for my final assignment in the Automation testing with Java and WebDriver course.

The final assignment is to test the logout button on the Skillo test website: http://training.skillo-bg.com:4300/posts/all

As part of the assignment there are two folders for Page Object Model and Page Factory.

The tests cover both the functionality and the visibility of the logout button.
