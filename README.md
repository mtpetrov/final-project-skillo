# final-project-skillo
This repository is created for my final assignment in the Automation testing with Java and WebDriver course.

The final assignment is to test the logout button on the Skillo test website: http://training.skillo-bg.com:4300/posts/all

The different parts of the project are commited into individual branches. 

In the master branch are commited the pom.xml showing the Maven dependencies, the TestNG.xml file used to perform the Chrome and Edge test in parallel and the gitignore file.

As part of the assignment there are two different branches for Page Object Model and Page Factory, and the test setup and test classes are uploaded into separate branches.

The tests cover both the functionality and the visibility of the logout button.
